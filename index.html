            <p>So you're in a group and you have these great singers with experience and energy and passion. But somehow things just aren't quite gelling the way they could.

Join Kate in a new class on how to lead, manage, and participate in a diverse group of creative people. Get everyone engaged, keep them on one page and learn new techniques for managing everyone from the loud to the quiet, the standouts to the supporters while having fun and getting more out of your group.</p>

            <p><strong>Tekay</strong></p>
            <p>So you think you hafta dance? As much as purists like to pretend it isn't, a cappella is as much a visual medium as it is an aural one. This intro class is for performance directors who want to break the semi-circle habit that plagues many groups. But it will also quell members' fear of becoming a show choir. Using some basic principles of staging and movement, you will be able to create a short scene for a song.  Groups are encouraged to attend to provide a quick masterclass example.</p>
