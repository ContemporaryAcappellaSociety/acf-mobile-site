            <h3>Find Your Strength in Visual Performance</h3>
            <p><strong>Gilewicz</strong></p>
            <p>There has been little innovation in the visual elements of live a cappella performance, with many groups retreating to minimal blocking or movement for comedic effect. This stagnation, particularly in collegiate performance, can be attributed to the misconceptions that interesting staging requires extensive dance experience or skill, and that movement necessarily detracts from the musicality of a performance. I intend to address both of these concerns in this workshop, with a focus on the former.</p>

            <p>Your Varsity Vocals producers want to make this the best competition season your group has ever had.

We’ll also get into common pitfalls, personal experiences (we’ve all competed previously) and how not to piss off your regional producer. (No seriously, please don’t break the rules!) Your questions are our priority in this panel, and we’ll get you prepped to cruise through the competition events this season with confidence and poise.</p>

            <h3>Taking Notice -- Watch Like a Critic</h3>
            <p><strong>Chin</strong></p>
            <p>Successful a cappella groups are reflective and use constructive criticism to better their groups. Groups that can evaluate their own performances in objective, meaningful ways stand the chance to develop and improve their live performance and recordings over time. In this session, groups will get hands on practice looking at a cappella through the eyes and ears of a critic. Attendees start by discussing big picture questions including what audiences notice most about groups, what identity a group projects, and how song selection affects audience perception. From there, attendees listen to segments of recorded a cappella songs and watch videos of live performances, first to take in holistic performances, then to focus in small groups on more granular elements of performance. The session reveals macro- and micro-level creative choices that can define an a cappella group’s level of success.</p>

            <h3>Women in A Cappella</h3>
            <p><strong>Malkoff & Panel</strong></p>
            <p>Historically, women have been the minority in the a cappella world. That’s an anomaly, as generally in the performing arts, there are more women than men. That percentage is now evening out, and women are finding their way in the world of vocal music, in groups and ensembles with and without men. Join us as we discuss the future of women in a cappella – what are our strengths, what we can improve upon, where are we headed? Men welcome!</p>

            <p>You've spent long hours perfecting those chords and rehearsing the perfect blend. Now it's time to present your music to an audience. Here are the important things to remember when creating, designing and presenting your "show".  Learn the important steps to take when turning your music into a "visual" medium.</p>

            <h3>Zero to Hero -- Group Growth</h3>
            <p><strong>Rishel</strong></p>
            <p>With hundreds of collegiate a cappella groups vying to make their mark, standing out from the crowd can be a challenge. This is especially true for new (or newly ambitious) groups lacking the power of name recognition from previous achievements. While it’s certainly possible to get very lucky with a viral video or celebrity tweet, a much more realistic first step is to make an impact within the a cappella community, as the metrics of success are reasonably well-defined and accessible. In this workshop, we will discuss how to objectively assess the strengths and weaknesses of a group (both artistic and logistical), consider the group’s context within the broader a cappella world, and use this as a framework to set realistic goals and develop specific strategies to achieve them.</p>

            <p><strong>Stevens</strong></p>
            <p>What is there to listen to, how might we listen to it, and why? In this interactive workshop we develop our critical-listening skills so as to recover our fundamental human capacity to be moved by music. A special focus is on songs, performances, and other moments that have been central to contemporary a cappella.</p>

            <p>Face it: your a cappella group could use a little therapy. Every group falls on hard times, whether you’re new to the game or a seasoned pro. We’re prepared to coach you through all of the struggles facing your group, from song selection and arranging, to publicity and branding, to the fundamental structure of your a cappella group. Come!

            <h3>Get Your Album on Track</h3>
            <p><strong>Koutzoukis, Green</strong></p>
            <p>How to plan and execute an album from the producers’ side of things. We constantly have groups come to us out of what appears to just be habit or routine. “Well, we record every two years, so it’s about time.” But WHY? What’s the goal? We want to talk about ways to create a vision for your project that will get the group AND the producer excited, and as a result, extract a better product from all involved parties.</p>

            <h3>Original Songwriting</h3>
            <p><strong>Holland</strong></p>
            <p>The past few years have seen more a cappella original music than possibly ever before. Where does one begin in writing a song? Where do ideas come from, and how do you keep them organized? What kinds of tools can be utilized if you hit a roadblock? How can you make your ideas as effective as possible? This course will break down the process of songwriting into manageable steps and give you the tools necessary to express your ideas and emotions in music.</p>
